          <p>Ink Tank users need an easy and efficient way to match with a
            potential tattoo artist who will work the best for them and find or
            expand upon their idea of what they want for a tattoo within a community
            of like-minded individuals who have a number of tattoos, are tattoo artists
            or are thinking of their first one.  A community atmosphere will diminish
            the number of individuals who regret getting a tattoo or have a bad experience.</p>

          <h4>What new hypotheses do you have?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><p>The augmented reality feature is not included in any of the content or
              screens.  First it will need to be added as a recognizable icon on the
              screens with tattoos.  Including the icon during the onboarding process
              will familiarize users with it when they see it throughout the app.
              A dedicated location within the app to access augmented reality will need
              to be added as well, likely under the profile or settings.</p></li>
            </ul>
          <h4>How will these hypotheses be validated?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><p>After going through updates for the screens and content, more questionnaires
              and preference tests will be conducted using Usabilityhub and simple emailing
              and sharing the prototype.</p></li>
            </ul>
          <h4>Are there any areas of your product you believe need specific improvements?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><p>The homepage and its content and how it is conveyed needs improvement as well
              as the whole onboarding process to allow users to skip or just continue as a
              guest to browse the content rather than having to sign-up.  Although the goal
              is to get users to book appointments through the app, getting them into the app
              first would be more applicable and then having them create a profile/account prior
              to booking or during the booking process will hook them while theyâ€™re already invested.</p></li>
            </ul>
          <h4>How might your user testing evolve as you begin to polish your application?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><p>User testing will involve to include more targeted demographics; tattoo enthusiasts,
              tattoo studios, tattoo artists, rather than the general populace which, while more
              people are getting tattoos, it will serve to get more concentrated insight from users
              who have tattoos and frequently get, give or browse tattoos.  More specific navigation
              within the app will also be tested</p></li>
            </ul>
          <h4>What is your timeline for improvement and implementation?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><p>The timeline will be a maximum of 4 weeks.</p></li>
            </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><p>Design iterations were performed with the gathered information from usability
            testing, preference testing, visual design principles, design accessibility,
            and design collaboration.</p></li>
            <li><p>Searching for an artist within the INKtank app needs to be quick, efficient
              and to the point so users will find what they're looking for and start the booking
              process for their first, third, tenth tattoo through our app as well.  </p></li>
            <li><p>The search process included an additional step while being wire framed which
              took the user longer to perform a search.</p></li>
            <li><p>The extra step was removed in the high fidelity wire framing to minimize
              additional screens and navigation for the user, streamlining the search process
              and allowing for always-present filters across the top.</p></li>
